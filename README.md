# firstexperimentrepo
A repository for my first attempt at using github without following instructions from a book

After the first day, I have created 2 new R files.

"1.) Analysis.R" is in a usable format, and the "2.) Modelling.R" is is predicting EQI using tidymodels framework.

These are both found in the Scripts folder.

Other folders created today include Data (which contains the ECE directory), Results, Reports, Figures and Docs.

report.html has also been created. It serves the purpose of quick and general EDA.
